## This is a metapool contract, sdk and testing suite for Algofi's nanopools

### Prerequisites

To run the the project:

- You must have NodeJs installed on your machine.
- Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies in your local folder.
- Create an .env file in the root directory with `Mnemo="Your 25 words"`
- To run the code as is you must opt-in the various test tokens and stable coins, the full list is in ./constants
- ./algofiSDK regroups convenience functions to mint / swap / burn in the target D981 - D552 testnet nanopool

### General considerations about the contract

In the contracts, stable 1 and stable 2 refer to the two stable coins of the target nanopool.

For the nanopools to work properly they must be called with the right amount of fees, calculated as base fee + extra compute fees in the front-end. In like manner for metaswaps and metazaps this amount is calculated and sent in appargs when calling the metapool contract so it can itself call the nanopool contract with the right fees.

Metaswaps and metazaps have slippage protection in the form of a minimum asset expected, set in app args. If the received amount is below that value the contract will fail.

Metazaps have an extra challenge in that they must get the proper ratio of stable 1 to stable 2 to mint the nanopool liquidity token. This proper ratio is obtained by swapping an appropriate amount of the stable coin sent by the user for the other stable coin.  
The math for a swap in a nanopool is too opcode expensive to be done in the metapool contract and is thus done in the front-end and set in appargs. As a backup, if no value is set in appargs, the metapool contract can estimate this amount by treating the nanopool like a regular pool.

### Deploy a new metapool

`npm run create-app` will deploy a new app with the constants from the relevant folder and bootstrap it. The target nanopool is D981 - D552, the metapool is made of test - AF-NANO-POOL-D981-D552.

Once the contract is deployed, its account is bootstrapped:

- 1 Algo is sent to it
- The account opts-in all the relevant tokens
- A metapool liquidity token is also created with total supply equal to max uint64.

### Metaswap

`npm run metaswap`

- Test token is sent to the metapool.
- Test is swaped for nanopool liquidity token.
- Nanopool LT is burned in nanopool.
- Metapool gets stable 1 & stable 2 from the nanopool.
- The stable coin we want to redeem is set in app args.
- Swap stable 1 for stable 2 or vice-versa in nanopool.
- Send the stable coin back to user.

### Metazap

`npm run metazap`

- Either stable 1 or stable 2 is sent to the metapool.
- Metapool converts it such as the resulting stable 1 / stable 2 ratio is equal to the nanopool stable 1 supply / stable 2 supply ratio.
- Send stable 1 and stable 2 to the nanopool to mint nanopool liquidity token.
- Swap the nanopool LT for test token in the metapool and send it back to the user.
- After minting the nanopool has us redeem any extra stable coins, these amounts are redeemed in the metapool and sent back to the user.

### Mint Metapool Liquidity Token

`npm run mint`

- For the first mint any ratio can be set
- For subsequent mints the proper ratio must be respected
- If there is any extra token to redeem an additional inner transaction will send it back to the user hence the appl fee is 3x min: call app, get metapool LT, possibly redeem extra token

### Swap test token for nanopool liquidity token, in the metapool

`npm run swap`

### Burn Metapool Liquidity Token

`npm run burn`

### Troubleshoot

Though it shouldn't be necessary, if you have issues running the scripts installing ts-node globally can help: `npm install -g ts-node`
